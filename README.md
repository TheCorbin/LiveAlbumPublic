# Live Album

Live Album is the a sample project made by Ryan Corbin.  This project is an Ionic 4 PWA with a firebase backend.  

Currently the app is hosted on my personal website: ryancorb.in

The purpose of the app is to allow events or parties to provide a single location where people can take photos.

Users should be able to:
  - Authenticate
    - Google
    - Facebook
    - Traditional email/password
    
  - Manage rooms
    - Create
    - Delete
    
  - Share Rooms
    - Input room code
    - Share room reference via QR code
  
  - Take Photos
    - Snap a photo to add to timeline
      - Timeline will update for other users without prompt
      
      
 Note:  If you would like to clone this you will need to add credentials to access your own firebase instance.
